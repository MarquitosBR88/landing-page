# Landing Page Project #
## The Project ##
This project is from The Odin Project and is about creating a landing page for a website, using html, css and flexbox.
## After Completing The Project ##
After finishing this project I realized that my CSS and Flexbox skills improved a lot, I was quite surprised by how easily I made this landing page, I'm really proud of myself.\
The Odin Project is really helping me to improve my skills on coding lately, I'm looking forward to learn JavaScript now!
